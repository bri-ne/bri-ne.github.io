                  This project investigates the spatial pattern of structure fires and fire risk factors across Guilford County, 
                  North Carolina with the purpose of building a model to predict future fire risk. The model uses 
                  information from past fires and latent risk to inform predictions in order to equip  
                  Guilford County EMS with a deeper understanding of where there is exposure to risk
                  and which parts of the county exhibit greater vulnerability, so that they can make data-driven decisions 
                 to establish a common standard of cover.

                Constrained by using a simple, but explainable linear regression model, we used this project to flex our feature engingeering skills. 
                <br><br>
                  In the fifteen years since its founding in 2006, Zillow has become synonymous with high-quality home price predictions. 
                  Following the national reckoning on the myriad of ways racism is embedded into American culture during the summer of 2020, 
                  many people within Zillow began questioning the product&#x27;s reliance on data collected by police departments.
                  <br> <br>
                  To this end, 
                  our research team (Briana Cervantes and Cypress Marrs) has 
                  spent the last few weeks exploring alternative indicators that might be used to replace crime data. 
                  We developed these metrics within Boulder County, CO. 
                  Although the model we developed lacks the predictive power of Zillow&#x27;s current model, 
                  we hope that our work on alternative indicators will inspire others, this time in prioritizing the public good within algorithm design.

                  In 2020, the rise of r/WallStreetsBets (WSB) exposed the nation to the reality-creating power of Reddit. 
                  We all watched, or maybe even participated, as the subculture of WSB spilled out over the stock market, 
                  turning internet ideas into IRL impacts. But given that Reddit is open to anyone and tends to promote user anonymity, 
                 bad actors can harness the platform&#x27;s culture-shifting power with the right resources, i.e. Bots.
                  <br><br>Working alongside my fellow

                  predicting gender from reddit comments, we developed a tool to predict robots in the comments of reddit posts.

                  At eNJine, we are making this possible.

                  As an Interpretation Park Ranger at the National Park Service, I developed several talks and presenations. Here's one that I developed with my colleague, Ranger Karen.

                    You’ve probably heard of the term civil disobedience, but did you know people were practicing it long before Rosa Parks and Dr. King? On June 7, 1892, a small group of activists in New Orleans broke the law in their fight against racial segregation. One of them, a man of color, bought a ticket for the white section of a train leaving New Orleans. That man was Homer Plessy.  

                    Watch <a href="https://nps.gov/people/homer-plessy.htm">the video</a> to discover what led to Homer Plessy’s act of defiance and to find out what happened next.

                  Serving as a Science Communicator through AmeriCorps, I helped to tell the story of the Coastal team at the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

                    This video makes the case for a new approach to Swamp Restoration, planting trees where they have disappeared, but not one-by-one or by hand. Instead, the coastal crew is applying a new technique - Aerial Seeding.
