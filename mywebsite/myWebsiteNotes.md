# notes for my website 
- concept: square to squiggles
  - the page starts with hard angles
  - and then angles get softer, lines get wavier as you scroll down
  - final is very sqiuggly 
  - first iteration will be static with just html and css
  - then maybe i can implement a fade to squiggles in js
